## Introduction

It's a CRUD system written in Spring Boot, with an API released via Postman.

## Technologies

- **Spring Boot** makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "
  just run".
- **Postgresql** Open-Source: PostgreSQL is an open-source database, which means it is freely available and can be modified and distributed by users.
  ```
  Advanced SQL Support: PostgreSQL supports a wide range of SQL features, including complex queries, indexes, views, and stored procedures.
  Data Integrity and Concurrency: It provides support for concurrent access to the database, allowing multiple users to work simultaneously without compromising     data integrity.
  Scalability: PostgreSQL can handle large amounts of data and supports horizontal scalability through features like table partitioning and replication.
  ```
